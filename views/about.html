    <p class="about-text"> Iâ€™m a recent graduate from Yale where I majored in architecture and designed and built a chair for my senior project. I spent last summer in Japan working at an architecture firm in Tokyo and researching traditional farmhouses. For the past few years, I worked at the Yale University Art Gallery as a guide and at the Yale Center for British Art in the conservation studio, which sparked a love of teaching and museums. l enjoy watercolor painting, biking, and collecting rocks. </p>
