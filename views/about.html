    <p class="about-text">My name is Katie Colford, and I am a student in the architecture major at Yale University, concentrating in design. Outside the studio, I give tours at the Yale University Art Gallery and tours of campus, and I have worked in the Conservation Department at the Yale Center for British Art. I spent the past summer in Japan with several fellowship awards from Yale, researching traditional tectonics and their spatial implications. I am fascinated by architecture as the intersection of art, philosophy, literature, science, and technology, and above all as an encounter with space. I am an avid painter and printmaker and love documenting my travels through art. </p>
